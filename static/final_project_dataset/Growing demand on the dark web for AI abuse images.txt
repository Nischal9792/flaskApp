A new study has found a clear desire among online offenders to learn how to create child sexual abuse material.
Research published by Anglia Ruskin University said evidence showed a growing demand for AI-generated images of child sexual abuse on the dark web.
Researchers Dr Deanna Davy and Prof Sam Lundrigan analysed chats that had taken place in dark web forums over the past 12 months.
Members of these forums have been actively teaching themselves how to create AI-generated child sexual abuse by accessing guides and videos online and sharing advice and guidance amongst themselves, the study found.
Forum members have 'hope'
Analysis also showed that forum members have been using their own supply of non-AI content in order to learn how to make the images.
Some of the members referred to those creating AI-imagery as "artists" while others shared hopes that the technology would evolve to make it easier to create material.
Dr Davy said AI-produced child sexual abuse material was a "rapidly growing problem" and added: "We need to understand a great deal more about precisely how offenders are creating it, how widely it is being shared and the impact it is having on offender pathways.
"There is a misconception that AI-generated images are 'victimless', and this could not be further from the truth.
"We found that many of the offenders are sourcing images of children in order to manipulate them, and that the desire for 'hardcore' imagery escalating from 'softcore' is regularly discussed."
